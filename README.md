# Banking Solution

Hello!  
This is my implementation of a **Banking Solution**.

## Getting Started

To run the application you need:

1. Open the Visual Studio solution.
2. Start the project as usual.

This project uses **SQLite**, so there's no need to set up a database

Iâ€™ve added some tests for service classes in the `Banking.Tests` project.
